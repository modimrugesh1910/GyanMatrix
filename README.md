GyanMetrix Data Scientist Hack on HackerEarth

For this hack 20 Years of Games dataset is used.

For result you can see this at - https://github.com/modimrugesh1910/GyanMatrix/blob/master/GyanMatrix.ipynb

# you can view the IPython notebook deploy on online at the following url and it just doing by copy above url at https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
You get online IPython notebook - https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/modimrugesh1910/GyanMatrix/blob/master/GyanMatrix.ipynb

# Answers of all questions

1) You can find code for the most "Editor's choice" awards, just run it and you obtain the answer. 
2) Here total no of game released on platform in a year have no effect on the no of editor's choice awards presented to game for a platform.
3) From above data we can say that every 2 MAC games released and reviewed, one gets Editor's Choice Award. Total number of Macintosh game is 81 and total number of awards given would be 40.
4) In the above graph we can see that the optimal month for releasing game is November followed by October. It means that companies have been releasing most of the games in October-November period.
5) Release of video games has decresed over the years, So plot a graph and understand it. 
6) Here we can see that the growth rate of the industry is decresing with years and less games are released every year. It's also not applicable to older data. The data doesn't consist of money(revenue), there may be some companies which are relasing less games but each game earn a lot of money. 

So Yeah That's all of hack .....!!!---:):):)
